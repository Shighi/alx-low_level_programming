# 0x10. C - Variadic functions

This project covers the implementation of variadic functions in C. It includes four tasks that demonstrate the use of `va_list`, `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end` macros.

## Files

* `variadic_functions.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
* `0-sum_them_all.c`: Function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
* `1-print_numbers.c`: Function that prints numbers.
* `2-print_strings.c`: Function that prints strings.
* `3-print_all.c`: Function that prints anything.

## Compilation

All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

## Usage

Include the header file in your C program:

```c
#include "variadic_functions.h"

This README provides a basic overview of your project, lists the files included, explains how to compile and use the functions, and includes sections for the author and acknowledgments. You can expand on this as needed for your specific project requirements.
