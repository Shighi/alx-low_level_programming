# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This project covers fundamental concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. It includes various functions that manipulate these elements.

## Files
* `0-reset_to_98.c`: Function that takes a pointer to an int and updates the value it points to to 98.
* `1-swap.c`: Function that swaps the values of two integers.
* `2-strlen.c`: Function that returns the length of a string.
* `3-puts.c`: Function that prints a string to stdout.
* `4-print_rev.c`: Function that prints a string in reverse.
* `5-rev_string.c`: Function that reverses a string.
* `6-puts2.c`: Function that prints every other character of a string.
* `7-puts_half.c`: Function that prints half of a string.
* `8-print_array.c`: Function that prints n elements of an array of integers.
* `9-strcpy.c`: Function that copies the string pointed to by src to dest.
* `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.

## Compilation
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Style
All code follows the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
