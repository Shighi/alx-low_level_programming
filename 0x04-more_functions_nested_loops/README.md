# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This project contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops. Each file in this repository corresponds to a specific task.

## Files and their descriptions:

0-isupper.c: A function that checks for uppercase character.
1-isdigit.c: A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
2-mul.c: A function that multiplies two integers.
3-print_numbers.c: A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9.
4-print_most_numbers.c: A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4.
5-more_numbers.c: A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14.
6-print_line.c: A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
7-print_diagonal.c: A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
8-print_square.c: A function that prints a square.
9-fizz_buzz.c: A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
10-print_triangle.c: A function that prints a triangle.

## Compilation
