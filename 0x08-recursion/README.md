# 0x08. C - Recursion

This project focuses on understanding and implementing recursive functions in C.

## Description

In this project, we explore the concept of recursion and implement various recursive functions to solve different problems. The tasks include printing strings, calculating string length, factorials, powers, square roots, and determining prime numbers.

## Files

* `0-puts_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string followed by a new line.
* `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: Function that prints a string in reverse.
* `2-strlen_recursion.c`: Function that returns the length of a string.
* `3-factorial.c`: Function that returns the factorial of a given number.
* `4-pow_recursion.c`: Function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
* `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: Function that returns the natural square root of a number.
* `6-is_prime_number.c`: Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
* `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files should end with a new line
* Code should use the Betty style
* No global variables allowed
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file called main.h
* You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
* You are not allowed to use static variables
