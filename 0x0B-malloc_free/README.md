# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

This project covers dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only malloc and free from the C standard library are allowed
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- The prototypes of all functions and _putchar should be included in main.h

## Tasks
0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings
2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
4. It's not bragging if you can back it up

## Files
- main.h: Header file containing function prototypes
- 0-create_array.c: Function that creates an array of chars
- 1-strdup.c: Function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory
- 2-str_concat.c: Function that concatenates two strings
- 3-alloc_grid.c: Function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
- 4-free_grid.c: Function that frees a 2 dimensional grid
