# Dynamic Libraries Project

This project consists of several tasks aimed at understanding dynamic libraries in C programming. Each task builds upon the concept of creating, manipulating, and using dynamic libraries to enhance program functionality.

## Tasks

### 1. Create a Dynamic Library
In this task, we are required to create a dynamic library from a set of C functions. The goal is to learn how dynamic libraries can be compiled and linked in C programs.

### 2. Script to Create Dynamic Libraries
A script is created to automate the process of compiling C files into a shared dynamic library. This task demonstrates how to streamline the creation of libraries in a development environment.

### 3. Override the `rand()` Function
This task involves overriding the standard `rand()` function to return a specific set of numbers. The modified behavior is achieved using a dynamic library, and the goal is to understand function interposition.

### 4. Script to Win
In this task, a script is written to preload a dynamic library that overrides certain functions, with the goal of achieving specific results when running a particular program.

## Requirements

- Knowledge of dynamic libraries in C
- Familiarity with Linux shell scripting
- Basic understanding of environment variables like `LD_PRELOAD`
