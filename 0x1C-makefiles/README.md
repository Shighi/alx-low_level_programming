# 0x1C. Makefiles

## Project Overview
This project involves learning the basics of Makefiles, which are used to automate the build process in C programming. You will create and work with Makefiles to compile C programs in various configurations, defining rules to manage the compilation process efficiently.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **GCC version**: 9.3.0
- **Make version**: GNU Make 4.2.1
- **File formatting**: All files must end with a new line

## Tasks

### Task 0: Simple Makefile
- Create your first Makefile to compile a program named `school`.

### Task 1: Makefile with Variables
- Extend your Makefile by using variables for the compiler (`CC`) and the source files (`SRC`).

### Task 2: Makefile with Object Files
- Refine the Makefile to use object files (`OBJ`) and ensure it recompiles only changed source files.

### Task 3: Complete Makefile with Rules
- Create a more comprehensive Makefile with rules like `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, and `re`.

### Task 4: Advanced Makefile
- Add more advanced flags such as `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wextra`, and `-pedantic` to improve compilation error handling.

### Task 5: Island Perimeter (Python)
- Implement a function to calculate the perimeter of an island described in a grid of integers, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land.

### Task 6: Advanced Makefile (Bonus)
- Advanced Makefile with additional features for cleanup and recompilation rules.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Shighi/alx-low_level_programming.git`
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd 0x1C-makefiles`

3. Run the Makefile:  
   `make -f [Makefile name]`

4. For Python tasks, use the following command:  
   `python3 [file name].py`
