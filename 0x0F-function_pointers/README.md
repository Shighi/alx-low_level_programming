# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

This project focuses on function pointers in C programming. It includes several tasks that demonstrate the use and implementation of function pointers.

## Files

* `0-print_name.c`: A function that prints a name using a function pointer.
* `1-array_iterator.c`: A function that executes a function on each element of an array.
* `2-int_index.c`: A function that searches for an integer in an array using a comparison function.
* `3-main.c`, `3-op_functions.c`, `3-get_op_func.c`, `3-calc.h`: A program that performs simple operations (+, -, *, /, %) on two numbers.
* `function_pointers.h`: Header file containing function prototypes for tasks 0-2.

## Compilation

All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags:
## Tasks

### 0. What's my name
Write a function that prints a name.

### 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

### 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
Write a function that searches for an integer.

### 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Write a program that performs simple operations.
